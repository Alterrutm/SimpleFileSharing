# SimpleFileSharing
A simple "file sharing service" for exchanging files between computers at maximum speed, no need to upload a file to the server and then download it, here the file is transmitted directly via java. Based on this code, you can create an interface or a full-fledged application. I managed to reach a top speed of 1.63 MB/1 millisecond.
